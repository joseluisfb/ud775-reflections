How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A bug appears when you add some code or when you modify some code. Both cases can be shown with a CVS going backwards.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You have a track of all your ideas, doubts and improvements.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically saving is a backup system. Manually savings are more logical: you known why and when code has been improved. Commits are for human beings, not for a computer track.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is code oriented: a commit affects a change in the whole application. Google Docs just backups each change of a file, without any logical relation with other files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log gives you track of all commits, diff shows the differences between versions.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    No problem at all: you always can go back (undo button!).


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Recode all Linux kernel!
