What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git/ directory is created and populated with metadata needed by git to
work.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the
repository. It contains working directory files that are candidates to be
committed to the repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    By adding only the files I want to be included in the next commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When you want different versions with different features, introduce some
experimental issues, particularities for different devices, OS, languages, etc.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Not only a graph way to see the project, but the only way (for now) to keep
track of "sons" you loose when you make a checkout. That's because log gives a
linear structure of the father of every checkout.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    The creation of a commit that joins both parents. Representation is a circle
pointing to two older commits simultaneously.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Automatic merging can join two code files easily. Manual merging is only
necessary when the same line was modified.
