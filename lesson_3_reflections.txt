When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Security: a cloud copy for if my hardware fails or I make a mistake.
    Colaboration: no solo projects. Work on different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I rather prefer to commit some changes before.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a GitHub copy of a repository whom you have write permission. GitHub
keeps track between the original and forked repository.
    Clone is a copy of a repository. Git can push or pull commits between both
repositories.
    Branches are different versions inside a repository that can evolve in a
different way and even merge again.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Keep my own version working while have a look to the last remote version
even offline.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Keeping multiple local copies of every file, and sending one ton of emails.
    Ok, I will try other revision control software and repository hosting, e.g.
subversion at SourceForge...


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Every time I type some code to be reviewed by a colleage. My code can be
merged on every master branch update, and I could make a pull request easily.
